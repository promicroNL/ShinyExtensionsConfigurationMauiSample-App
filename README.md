# Introduction
This app is sample implementation of the [Shiny ExtensionsConfiguration]([url](https://github.com/shinyorg/ConfigurationExtensions)).
A great package to use and save configurations in Maui via [Microsofts ConfigurationExtensions]([url](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.configuration?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0))

## What does it do?
It changes the value of the appsetting configuration key "myAppSetting" from Hello to Bye, and vice versa.

Please note that at the moment this is only tested in Android.
The change is permanent and saved on the android device.
